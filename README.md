This, at the moment, is just a fun little side project I'm working on. The idea is to build a matchmaking
app for professionals of all kinds.

And while I'm at it to learn a bit of new tech - I've started to pick up Vue and finally kill that nasty and well-documented bad habit of mine of using jQuery.

I wanted to open source it for the time being somewhat selfishly so that I could get feedback from people to
potentially help me see any problems with my code, etc. Also if I'm sharing something out that I'm working on
it will be handy to be able to just link directly to code.

However, I do think that if this goes well I will probabably make it commercial and un-open-source it--so don't go building your future hopes and dreams relying upon this to be open source forever. That said if someone gets involved with the project and is cool and is interested in deploying it in some specific niche that they're into, I'd probably be down with that post-commercialization.

Oh, and also, since I'm not primarily open sourcing this as something for others to use and to suppor them in that, I'm probably not going to be looking to provide a ton of support to people that are looking for help installing in their local environment, etc. So like I don't have installation instructions right now - if you want to dig in and can figure out how to install it and want to PR to this readme installation instructions, by all means go for it!
