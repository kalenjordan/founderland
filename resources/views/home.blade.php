                    This platform is to facilitate various types of matchmaking. Having run a
                    <a href="https://commercehero.io">matchmaking platform</a> in a specific eCommerce developer niche successfully
                    for the last 2 years, I'm taking some of the learnings from that, and trying to create an offering that's a little bit more broad and flexible.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    I'm not exactly sure what audiences will be best served by this, but currently the platform is being seeded with people in the communities that I'm most connected toâ€”eCommerce professionals, developers, and bootstrapped software founders.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    As the number of people on the platform grows, the value that we can provide in matchmaking for the purposes of hiring employees, contractors, or even finding a co-founder, advisor, or investor should improve.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
